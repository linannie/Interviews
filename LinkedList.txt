ALL ABOUT LINKED LISTS


Linked List is a linear data structure.
The elements aren't stored at a contiguous location, they're linked with pointers.

head --> [data | next] --> [d | n] --> [d | n] --> NULL


  Linked List has a pointer to the first node of the list called HEAD. Each node contains data
  and a pointer to the next node.


      LINKED LIST ADVANTAGES
        - dynamic size
        - ease of insertion/deleion
     
      DISADVANTAGES
        - random access NOT allowed (only sequential)
        - more space taken for the pointer
